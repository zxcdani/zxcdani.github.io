Hello, this is basically my first post. The previous one's a jekyll default, I didn't delete it because it's awesome.

Anyway, I am making new apps - A Facial Recognition App in WPF and A Cyber Cafe Management App. All of them are for the dekstop platform, the latter one is cross-platform though.
For the first one, I am using Emgu CV as the recognizing engine. For the latter, I am using Eto Forms to make it cross-platform across desktop OSes.
And oh, those two will be open source, yehey everyone.

Watch out for my first two open source projects, please?

Thanks.
