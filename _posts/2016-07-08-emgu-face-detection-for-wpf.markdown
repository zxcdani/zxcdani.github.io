Lately, I've been playing around with Emgu CV's face detection features and it works really well. As I am fond
developing apps for the WPF platform, I made one for it too. I'll try to update this one from time to time,
but please take note that the purpose of this app is to be a "base" app for your Face Detection needs.

Right now, the app has few number of features, here they are:

* Clean Material Design UI
* SQLite Database
* Ability to **Add User** with Name
* Ability to **Take Logs** with Date and Time
* Ability to **Show All Logs** in a list
* Ability to filter all logs
* And written in **MVVM Pattern** for scalability

Just download the source, fire up the solution and you're good. I'll be adding the ability to edit users in
the future and view the user's face on the Logs Tab. Meanwhile, take a look at the source on [Github](https://github.com/zxcdani/EmguFaceDetectionWPF)
